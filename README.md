# RadSim
**University:** Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University

**Organization:** Society 4 S.P.A.C.E.

**Project:** Project S.H.I.E.L.D.

**Objective:** Simulate radiation particle interaction with an electro-magnetic shield on a spacecraft.

## Instructions on running
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/MrPilotMan/RadSim/releases) file titled `RadSim.zip`.
2. Unzip and open `RadSim.m` in MatLab.
3. Adjust `requestedParticles`, `scale`, and `delta` variables in `radsim.m` as desired.
   1. Setting `requestedParticles` higher will demand significantly more RAM to display the plots. It is advisable to run more simulations with a lower `requestedParticle` size.
   2. Making `scale` larger does not produce better graphs and will significantly slow down each particles simulation.
   3. Setting `delta` to a lower numeric value will increase the granularity of the simulation, but results in a roughly linear time increase.
5. There are a number of premade `wireGeometry` data files in `../wireGeometry`, but the option to set your own variables remains.
  1. To use the included data, make sure `load('wireGeometry/1e4.mat');` is uncommented and `wireGeometry = generateWireGeometry(innerRadius, torusRadius);` is commented out. Then replace the file name (eg. 1e4.mat) with your desired data.
    1. All the included data files are multiples of 10 (eg. 1e4 is equivelant to `turns = 1000;`).
  2. If you wish to gereate the `wireGeometry` during the simulation, make sure the above two lines are reversed and you have manually set any variables in `generateWireGeometry.m`.
6. If you want to run the simulation in parallel, simply set `parallel = true`.
   1. On termination or completion, MatLab will display the plots.
